    body: "Due to the burgeoning of machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, it may feel as though there are eyes perpetually watching us. It is undeniable that, whether it is through surveillance cameras, phones, or desktops, we are always exposed to being analyzed by merely living our everyday lives. The most frightening part about this phenomenon is that how and what these technologies record is oftentimes a mystery. As our society begins to yield more responsibility and credibility to image analysis and other machine learning software, we should know how they work before we collectively make informed decisions about them. So this application will bring you through the process of facial analysis to give you some insight into what your machine will typically see!"

The images are also labelled as one of two genders and nine age groups. Our biased dataset is a subset of our original dataset and is biased in regards to race. The distribution percentages were referenced from the US census data, thus the biased model is representative of a model trained on the US population."
